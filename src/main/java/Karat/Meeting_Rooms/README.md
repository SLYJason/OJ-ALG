# Meeting Rooms
We are writing a tool to help users manage their calendars. Given an unordered list of times of day when people are busy, write a function that tells us the intervals during the day when ALL of them are available.

Each time is expressed as an integer using 24-hour notation, such as 1200 (12:00), 1530 (15:30), or 800 (8:00).

Sample input:
```
p1_meetings = [
  (1230, 1300),
  ( 845, 900),
  (1300, 1500),
]

p2_meetings = [
  ( 0, 844),
  ( 930, 1200),
  (1515, 1546),
  (1600, 2400),
]

p3_meetings = [
  ( 845, 915),
  (1515, 1545),
  (1235, 1245),
]
```

Sample output:

```
schedules1 = [p1_meetings, p2_meetings, p3_meetings] -> [0, 844] [845, 930] 
schedules2 = [p1_meetings, p3_meetings]

findAvailableTimes(schedules1)
 => [  844,  845 ],
    [  915,  930 ],
    [ 1200, 1230 ],
    [ 1500, 1515 ],
    [ 1546, 1600 ]

findAvailableTimes(schedules2)
 => [    0,  845 ],
    [  915, 1230 ],
    [ 1500, 1515 ],
    [ 1545, 2400 ]
```
