# Binary Tree Top-Down View
Given the root of a binary tree, return a list of values of the nodes that would be seen from the "top down" perspective of the tree, as seen from "left to right".

Input: TreeNode.
Output: List of integers.

```markdown
		1
	2       3
4       5       6 
```
Would return `{4, 2, 1, 3, 6}`.

Use the idea from LC314: Binary Tree Vertical Order Traversal.
