# 323: Number of Connected Components in an Undirected Graph

### Solution 1: DFS
Assuming `n` is number of nodes, `m` is the number of edges.

**Time Complexity:** `O(n + m)`. Generally, dfs takes `O(V + E)`, `V` is number of vertex, `E` is the number of edges. 

**Space Complexity:** `O(n)`.

### Solution 2: BFS
Assuming `n` is number of nodes, `m` is the number of edges.

**Time Complexity:** `O(n + m)`. Generally, bfs takes `O(V + E)`, `V` is number of vertex, `E` is the number of edges. 

**Space Complexity:** `O(n)`.

### Solution 3: Union Find
Assuming `n` is number of nodes, `m` is the number of edges.

**Time Complexity:** `O(n + m)`.

**Space Complexity:** `O(n)`.
