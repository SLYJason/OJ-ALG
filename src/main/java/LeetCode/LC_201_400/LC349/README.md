# 349: Intersection of Two Arrays

### Solution 1: Two Sets
**Time Complexity**: `O(M + N)`. `M` and `N` are the size of array `nums1` and `nums2`.

**Space Complexity**: `O(M + N)`.

### Solution 2: Sorting + Two Pointers
**Time Complexity**: `O(M * logM + N * logN)`.

**Space Complexity**: `O(min(M, N))`.
