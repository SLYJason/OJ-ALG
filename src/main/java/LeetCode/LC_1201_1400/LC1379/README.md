# 1379: Find a Corresponding Node of a Binary Tree in a Clone of That Tree

### Solution 1: Iterative
Using iterative preorder traversal. It also solves the follow-up question, i.e. repeated values on the tree are allowed.

**Time Complexity:** `O(N)`.

**Space Complexity:** `O(H)`, `H` is the height of the tree.

### Solution 2: Recursive
**Time Complexity:** `O(N)`.

**Space Complexity:** `O(H)`, `H` is the height of the tree.
