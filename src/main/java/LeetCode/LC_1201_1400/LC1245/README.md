# 1245: Tree Diameter

Use this theory:
1. Start at any node A and traverse the tree to find the furthest node from it, let's call it B.
2. Having found the furthest node B, traverse the tree from B to find the furthest node from it, lets call it C.
3. The distance between B and C is the tree diameter.
