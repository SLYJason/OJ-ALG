# 15: 3Sum

### Solution 1: Two-Sum Logic
Keep in mind the Map structure is `K -> num`, `V -> count of num` because we need to skip duplicates.

**Time Complexity:** `O(N^2)`.

**Space Complexity:** `O(N)`.

### Solution 2: Two Pointers
Logic is same as `167: Two Sum II - Input array is sorted`.

**Time Complexity:** `O(N^2)`.

**Space Complexity:** `O(N)` or `O(logN)` depending on the sorting.
