# 38: Count and Say

### Solution 1: Recursive
Just using the recursive solution based on the description, similar to fibonacci number problem.

**Time Complexity:** `O(N ^ 2)`. The recursion can go up to depth of `N`, and each node contains a string need to be processed, so it will be `O(N ^ 2)`.

**Space Complexity:** `O(N ^ 2)`.

### Solution 2: Iterative
**Time Complexity:** `O(N ^ 2)`.

**Space Complexity:** `O(N ^ 2)`.
