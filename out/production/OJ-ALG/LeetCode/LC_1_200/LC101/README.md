# 101: Symmetric Tree

### Solution 1: DFS
Time Complexity: `O(N)`, N is the number of nodes.

Space Complexity: `O(N)`, N is the number of nodes.

### Solution 2: BFS
Time Complexity: `O(N)`, N is the number of nodes.

Space Complexity: `O(N)`, N is the number of nodes.

Keep in mind: LinkedList allows null, but ArrayDeque not.
